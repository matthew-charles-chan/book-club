# Book People
Find your people. Find your books.

## What is Book People?

The internet has provided opportunities for increasingly more niche communities to find one another and share content and experiences. When it comes to book recommendations, large services like Amazon, Goodreads, or even public libraries and book stores fall short in offering categorization, recommendations, or searchability when extreme specificity is required.

It's easy enough to browse titles in the Science and Technology category, but what if a user wants a new book specifically about geomorphology of the planet Venus, or challenges of implementing thorium reactors? For these topics, users are left scouring message boards or hoping to run across an expert in the wild.

This Book Club app seeks to solve this problem by allowing users to create communities around their favourite topic, pull in books to a shared collection, and append their own specific metadata and categorization heirarchy. They can then share this with others and provide common spaces for niche communities to geek out about their favourite topics.
